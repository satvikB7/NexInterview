NexInterview is an innovative, AI-driven interview preparation system that dynamically generates personalized technical, HR, and behavioral questions using advanced NLP. The platform employs transformer-based models (such as GPT and T5) for question generation and leverages sentiment analysis (using VADER and BERT-based models) alongside machine learning techniques to evaluate responses in real time. This results in adaptive feedback that enhances candidate articulation, confidence, and overall interview performance all presented through a comprehensive analytics dashboard.
